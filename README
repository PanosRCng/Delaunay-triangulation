Python implementation of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm 
as described in http://paulbourke.net/papers/triangulate/

  --> module usage
	after imported, call the getTriangulation(vertex_list)
		
	the vertex_list is a list with instances of the Vertex class (as defined in this file)
	returns the vertex_list, and a list with instances of the Triangle class (as defined in this file)

  (!) duplicate points will result in undefined behavior
